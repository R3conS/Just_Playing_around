## Website Description

The website is for a car insurance and highway code testing company Ornikar, the website is responsive and has multiple eye catching elements like estimating my rate and connexion.

It's also contains different regions, one for estimating you're custum rate,  the second one is twhy you should join Ornikar, the 3rd one is some testemony.

## Test planning and why

1. If all buttons works.
2. All the buttons that have the same purpose should be checked with different resolutions :
    . Estimer mon tarif
    . Je me lance
    . J'obtiens mon devis

I think it's called the Dynamic approach.

## Three Amigos

I will start by telling them that the website is responsive and will be beginning by testing all redirections in all parts of the website ( first amigo : Code de la route + Connexion , second one : Permis de conduire, third one : Assurance Auto) with different resolutions.

## Test strategy 

I will start by looping in the website.

## Framework use ( SELENIUM/ PythonBehave )
